# Vulnerability Scanner

**Vulnerability_Scanner** is a multi-threaded network scanning tool that allows users to scan a target for open ports, detect running services, and retrieve banner information. It also attempts to identify the version of specific services like SSH, HTTP, and FTP. The scanner is built using Python and is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to use, making it ideal for basic vulnerability assessment and reconnaissance.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans a range of ports on a target IP address to determine whether they are open or closed.
- **Service Detection**: Identifies common services such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP running on the open ports.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieves and displays service banners to aid in identifying the service version and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-threaded**: Uses threading to perform faster scans by simultaneously scanning multiple ports.
- **Service Version Detection**: Attempts to extract the version of services like SSH, HTTP, and FTP based on the banner information.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: This script is built using Python and requires Python 3.x to run.
- **Libraries**: The following Python libraries are used:
  - `socket`: For network connections and port scanning.
  - `threading`: To speed up the scanning process using multiple threads.
  - `tabulate`: For formatting scan results in a tabular format.
  - `argparse`: To handle command-line arguments.
  - `re`: For regex-based service version extraction.

You can install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tabulate
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Vulnerability_Scanner.git
cd Vulnerability_Scanner
```

2. Install the required Python libraries (as mentioned above):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed and correctly configured on your system.

## Usage

To run the Vulnerability Scanner, simply execute the `Vulnerability_Scanner.py` script with the target IP address and port range as arguments.

```bash
python Vulnerability_Scanner.py <target_IP> <start_port> <end_port>
```

### Example

```bash
python Vulnerability_Scanner.py 192.168.1.1 20 100
```

This will scan the target IP `192.168.1.1` from port `20` to `100`.

## Command Line Options

- `target`: The target IPv4 address to scan.
- `ports_start`: The starting port number for the scan.
- `ports_end`: The ending port number for the scan.

### Example Usage

```bash
python Vulnerability_Scanner.py 192.168.0.105 80 8080
```

This command will scan ports from `80` to `8080` on the IP address `192.168.0.105`.

## Example Output

Below is an example of the output you can expect after running the scanner:

```
Welcome to my Basic Vulnerability Scanner!

Port 22 is open! Banner: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3 Service: SSH Version: OpenSSH_8.2p1
Port 80 is open! Banner: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) Service: HTTP Version: Apache/2.4.41
Port 21 is closed
Port 443 is open! Banner: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu) Service: HTTP Version: nginx/1.18.0

+--------+---------+-------------------+
|  Port  | Service |      Version      |
+--------+---------+-------------------+
|   22   |   SSH   | OpenSSH_8.2p1     |
|   80   |  HTTP   | Apache/2.4.41     |
|  443   |  HTTP   | nginx/1.18.0      |
+--------+---------+-------------------+
```

## Customization

### Supported Services
The scanner currently detects the following services:
- **SSH**
- **HTTP** (Apache, nginx)
- **FTP**

To add more services, modify the `self.service_patterns` dictionary in the `VulnerabilityScanner` class to include new service banners and patterns.

### Threading
By default, the scanner uses up to `50` threads to perform port scans. You can adjust the `max_threads` variable in the `port_scan_threaded` function to change the number of concurrent threads.

### Timeouts
The socket timeout is set to `0.5` seconds for each port scan. This value can be adjusted in the `scan_port` function by modifying the `sock.settimeout()` call.
